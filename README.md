  <h4>A lightweight game framework for Lua and C++</h4>
  <h5>*Most of these meantioned features are not supported yet because of very early development of iLuma</h4>
</div>


## About the Project

iLuma is a modern, high-performance game framework (3D and 2D) built by passion and designed for fun development of games and interactive applications on all major desktop and mobile platforms. It's designed to be used very close to functionality of a full game engine like Unity, but also gives you the control to dive into the nitty-gritty low-level code. iLuma is in the very early stages of development. 

## Features

- ✨ Cross-platform support: Build games for desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS) and mobile (iOS, Android) from a single codebase.
- 📱 Touch and sensor input support for mobile devices.
- 📂 Open source and actively developed.
- 🌙 Recommended use of Lua

## Supported Platforms

- Desktop
  - Windows (using Vukan)
  - Linux (using Vukan)
  - macOS (using MoltenVK)
- Mobile
  - iOS (using MoltenVK)
  - Android (using Vukan)
- Web (using OpenGL ES 3.0 -> WebGL 2.0)
- VR
  - Meta Quest 2/3 Standalone (using Vulkan)
  - Pico Headsets Standalone (using Vulkan)
  - PCVR (using desktop-specific graphics API)
